Virtualenv

virtualenv is a tool to create isolated python environments. It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn't share libraires with other virtualenv environments and optionally doesn't access the globally installed libraries either.

Installation:
	[sudo] pip install virtualenv

Usage:
	virtualenv ENV
  where ENV is the directory which stores the virtual environment. Libraries are present in ENV/bin and ENV/include.
  We can use /ENV/bin/python in scripts and run pip from ENV/bin/pip

Activating the virtualenv adds the path to the $PATH environment variable. 
	source bin/activate
	
This also changes the prompt.

To deactivate:
	deactivate
This removes all the changes.

To remove an ENV:
	deactivate
	rm -rf ENV
