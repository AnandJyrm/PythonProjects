		os.walk()
	
		#!/usr/bin/python
		import sys
		import os

		def listFiles(input_path):
			for root,dirs,files in os.walk(input_path,topdown=False):
				for name in files:
					print os.path.join(root, name)

		if __name__ == "__main__":

Q. What tools do you use for linting, debugging and profiling?

Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors. Lint was the name originally given to a particular program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code. The term is now applied generically to tools that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language. Popular linting tools are flake8 and pylint. Flake 8 is simple and concise, pylint has more setup and is more comprehensive/judgemental. You can build it into your editor as well.
